How to Train Your Compiler
==========================

You probably use a compiler or an interpreter every day, but do you know how
they work? The first compilers were designed more than 60 years ago, but
writing a compiler is still viewed as a challenge. However, brave knight, do
not fear! Equipped with modern tools and theory we can slay the dragon! Along
your journey you will likely gain insights about the trade offs made during the
design and implementation of your favorite language.

We'll look at the major components of compilers and interpreters and the theory
behind their design. First we'll discuss compilers and the difference between
the compiler's front end and back end with examples in simple C code. We'll
explain the process of lexing, parsing, and machine code generation, and
some common analysis techniques and optimizations. Then we'll examine
interpreters through the lens of Python and compare and contrast different
designs. We'll look at the trade offs made during interpretation and
compilation and how they will affect the code you write.

This talk has been presented at Beaver BarCamp in April, 2015 and is being
further refined.
